            "second": "The main focus in the eighties was the establishment of a nationwide network of branches in the old Federal Republic in order to meet the growing demands of forwarding customers. After the political turnaround in 1989, NEUFRA-Spedition also expanded into the new federal states. Parallel to the expansion of the German branch network, the strategic decision was made in the 1990s to develop NEUFRA into a European freight forwarding company. As a consequence, subsidiaries were founded in Italy and Hungary.",
            "third": "After the turn of the millennium, subsidiaries followed in Austria, Poland, Spain and the Czech Republic. Currently, of course, digitization is also playing a special role. Not only have administrative processes been and are being digitally simplified for NEUFRA and its business partners, but the development of its own web application and app for freight management also secure the future of the NEUFRA Group in the digital age."
